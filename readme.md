# Dance Game Site Concept

## Intro

This was originally pitched as a concept for a website update. I thought it would be interesting to use Three.js but in a "static" website. Three.js and the imported models are essentially just a background to the main site. I like the idea of a story being told in the background. As you scroll the perspective of what is happening changes. As you scroll the camera changes popsition and the character animations change.
I think it works well as a POC, but definitely needs further refinement.
